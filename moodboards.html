    <p>The two moodboards I generated are very different in the tone and mood they give off. I think they speak to slightly different audiences, although the look and feel of either moodboard I don't feel will drive a certain audience away from the site either. Below, I'll describe a bit of what my moodboards convey.</p>
    <article id="moodboard1">
      <h2>Moodboard 1</h2>
      <img src="moodboard1.png" alt="moodboard 1" />
      <p>This first moodboard represents a more elegant, muted look and feel. Some of the images include a headshot, slightly symbolizing that I'm planning to have a spotlighted artist and designer on the landing page. The color and general direction are minimal, and the works are shown fairly simply. I like seeing just the color in the works, themselves, as well as having a small pop of color, too, so that the artist or designer and their works can have an even more prominent spotlight. The more muted pallette would serve as a nice vessel for any kind of artist or designer to take the light.</p>

    <article id="moodboard2">
      <h2>Moodboard 2</h2>
      <img src="moodboard2.png" alt="moodboard 2" />
      <p>This second moodboard speaks to a more playful tone â€“ one that's more expressive, bold, and fun. With artists and designers, that can seem like the more obvious approach. I enjoy the bright pops of saturated hues, but I wonder if that might turn some people away who are not accustomed to things quite so vibrant and loud. This moodboard does give me a nicer sense of the play that's involved and gives off more of a directed, happier mood that may be right for this sharing, communal atmosphere.</p>
