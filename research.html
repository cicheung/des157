    <article id="research">
      <p>In the three articles I read through, and many of the other articles I skimmed through to select these three, I noticed many similarities and trends among them. Simply googling for art- and design-related articles turned up many articles that were mainly fleshed out listicles – there wasn’t a lot of purely informative content or any in-depth research and analyses on how artists and designers showcase their work. Another observation about general research on art and design is that there really tends to be more emphasis and resources for the “top” or “most popular” fields of design in this era. Most of the articles I saw were targeted towards graphic design, digital design, UI/UX design, web design, and interaction design. It seems that there is not enough representation among designers, just based on the initial content when quickly researching my topic. I had to dig much deeper and more specific in order to find the kind of informative content I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>In many of these articles, I learned about many types of designers I had never really considered before, and that, I think should be the goal of this project. Giving those under-represented artists a platform to showcase their work and not be hidden. It’s important for all artists and designers to have exposure. Entire subsets of designers shouldn’t be swept under the rug simply because live in an increasingly digital age. From sculptors to a subgenre of furniture designers, from stamp makers to cake decorators – these are all professions that deserve to be highlighted. And as the research shows, each of them have vastly interesting stories as to how they came to choose and enter their professions. The more exposure people (in general, but artists and designers in particular) have to large varieties of professions and creative outlets, the more we can learn from one another. It’s a very powerful tool to be able to share with one another, as cross-disciplinarily, we can achieve even more.
      </p>
      <p>Two other articles spoke more to the ways to connect and share with artists and designers. There are a million different ways, it turns out, to do this – and not just through digital means although it is definitely a crucial part of an artist or designer’s exposure. Some ways that Maryam Taheri brought up included: connecting with design blogs, creating an online portfolio, being a specialist, and offering freebies. In these ways, artists and designers a creating a community of giving, taking, and sharing so that we as a community can grow and learn more and more.
      </p>
      <p>In “Online design communities freelancers should be a part of,” resources were broken up into subsections: design portfolio communities, graphic design forums, Slack for designers, Facebook for designers, and professional design organizations. Under each subsection, there were links to more specific resources. Turns out that the community is there – artists and designers just have to find it and participate in it. It’s interesting that now messaging and social channels like Slack and Facebook have become part of connecting with the design community.
      </p>
      <p>All in all, the research opened me up to even more varieties of design and reminded me that every artist and designer deserves to have their work and process and journey shown. The research also showed me what existing solutions are there and what is still lacking, especially for designers who are not in the digital and tech-related fields.
