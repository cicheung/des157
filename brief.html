      <h2>TOPIC SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>The final project is meant to increase diversity of not only different mediums of art and design, but also diversity of artists and designers. Beyond just the most popular types of art and design, especially in an increasingly technological age, what artists, designers, and creative fields can we all learn from? The point is to share our work and stories with one another to build a community of more diverse, well-informed artists and designers, who can learn from one another and apply the lessons from each of us into our own work. As a platform and vessel to champion diverse artists and designers, it’s important to allow for a space to truly understand a single artist or designer’s work and journey thus far.
      </p>
      <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
      <p>Our target audience is artists and designers, first and foremost, but more specifically underrepresented artist and designers – whether this means that their work is underrepresented or their background is, it doesn’t matter. We want this project to be a platform and voice for artist and designers to share and feel like they can finally express themselves through their work and journey to a community (aka our secondary audience) that wants to learn more about the artists and designers around them. Our secondary audience includes people who want to gain inspiration from works and people in their fields or neighboring fields and be willing to be pushed as artists and designers.
      </p>
      <h2>GOALS</h2>
      <p>There are a couple higher-level goals that encompass the project: a landing page spotlight (connected to archived profiles), people exploration, work exploration, and an area for community-building. <br> The very first thing I want is a spotlight of an artist or designer showcasing who they are – their essence, their background. This will also include selected works, contact information, etc. I also want to make sure that these spotlights are connected to another section that shows previous spotlights, so visitors of the site have a fleshed out view of the different creatives that are the backbone to the site’s core mission. <br> Next, people exploration. Having a general platform for people to display their work and skills, like a built-in mini portfolio would be a great addition. This would allow for easy searching of new and diverse artists and designers, as well as giving them more exposure to curious creatives or even to recruiters and hiring managers. <br> Work exploration is another important section, which will essentially allow for a free flow of work from members of the site. Of course there should be filters for this as well. <br> Lastly, a main goal I have for this site is to have a community-building area where site members can discuss with one another and become connected to each other more easily. A combination of Reddit’s subcommunities and forums all over the web is what I’m thinking about; however, we will need to refine this idea.
      </p>
      <h2>COMMUNICATION STRATEGY</h2>
      <p>Since this is a site targeted for artists and designers, communication must be as visual and aesthetic as possible. This will likely include iconography, a lot of images, short blurbs, clean and concise text, and possibly videos as well. In order to encourage underrepresented, diverse people to use the site, we will need to make sure that it’s easily accessible in terms of the user interface and experience so that at no point is the process confusing or intimidating. We need to prioritize encouragement first.
      </p>
      <h2>LOOK AND FEEL</h2>
      <p>To keep it understated, but still packed with content, the site will consist of three main tabs as described in the four main goals (with a logo leading back to the home page). The look of the site will be clean, mostly neutral colors, with accent colors on the tabbed pages. The homepage will likely incorporate a brighter look, and may be influenced by the spotlighted artist or designer. I want this site to feel as welcoming, friendly, and approachable as possible. Clean lines, friendly type, more usage of organic shapes, and bolder colors can often achieve that.
